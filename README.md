# QMSS x IBM Practicum Project

This project was conducted as part of the QMSS Practicum Course at Columbia University, in partnership with IBM.

## Project Description
White House Executive Orders play a critical role in setting strategic directions for the nation. Both the Public and government agencies have a vested interest in understanding these directives. The public seeks clarity on the benefits and implications, while government agencies need to grasp their responsibilities and ensure compliance. Thus, the team aims to explore leveraging Generative AI to enhance comprehension of these orders for both audiences. We hope to create a Generative AI web application to answer questions according to Executive Order documents.

## Data
The data comes from White House Executive Orders (Source: https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders).

The process of extracting and cleaning the data is saved in the [data](https://github.com/JiayingFang01/QMSS_IBM_Practicum/tree/main/data) folder.

## App Development
This project is using RAG for the app development. You can find more details in the [rag](https://github.com/JiayingFang01/QMSS_IBM_Practicum/tree/main/rag) section.
