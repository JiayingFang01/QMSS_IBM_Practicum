# QMSS x IBM Practicum Project

This project was conducted as part of the QMSS Practicum Course at Columbia University, in partnership with IBM.

## Project Description
White House Executive Orders play a critical role in setting strategic directions for the nation. Both the Public and government agencies have a vested interest in understanding these directives. The public seeks clarity on the benefits and implications, while government agencies need to grasp their responsibilities and ensure compliance. Thus, the team aims to explore leveraging Generative AI to enhance comprehension of these orders for both audiences. We hope to create a Generative AI web application to answer questions according to Executive Order documents.
