Policy. During 2020, the last year of the                  prior administration, homicides in the Nation increased                  nearly 30 percent over the previous year--the largest                  1-year increase in murders ever recorded. After that,                  the Vice President and I took action to reduce gun                  crime and other forms of violent crime. By the middle                  of 2022, we had already taken more executive action to                  reduce gun violence than any other administration at                  that point in time. On June 25, 2022, I signed into law                  the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (Public Law 117-                 159)--the most significant new gun violence prevention                  law in nearly 30 years. Rates of homicide in the United                  States are falling at one of the fastest rates ever                  recorded. Year-over-year comparison shows that 2023 had                  one of the largest declines in the homicide rate in                  recent history. This life-saving progress has continued                  in 2024. While we have made great progress, much more                  work remains to be done to reduce gun violence and save                  lives.                  It is the policy of my Administration to coordinate                  across executive departments and agencies (agencies) to                  reduce gun violence and save lives. This order directs                  enhanced coordination for two key challenges: combating                  emerging firearms threats and understanding and                  improving school-based active-shooter drills.                  One way to continue the progress on reducing gun                  violence is to stay ahead of emerging violent crime                  threats involving firearms. My Administration has                  always taken these threats seriously. In April 2021,                  one of my Administration's first executive actions to                  reduce gun violence was directed at stopping the                  proliferation of firearms without serial numbers, often                  referred to as ``ghost guns.'' To expand these efforts,                  the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and                  Explosives (ATF) of the Department of Justice                  established an Emerging Threats Center, which focuses                  ATF's resources on identifying developments in illicit                  firearm marketplaces, including the use of new                  technologies to make and unlawfully distribute                  undetectable firearms and devices that convert                  semiautomatic firearms into illegal machineguns. The                  Vice President and I strongly disagreed with the                  Supreme Court's decision to strike down an important                  gun safety regulation on bump stocks--the device used                  in the shooting at a crowded music festival in Las                  Vegas--and called on the Congress to clarify that this                  dangerous accessory is a machinegun.                  The Court's decision addressing bump stocks did not                  alter the statutory prohibition on machinegun                  conversion devices, which are prohibited for non-                 governmental possession even when not installed on a                  firearm. The threat posed by the continued                  proliferation of these devices is particularly acute.                  These devices enable semiautomatic firearms, including                  easily concealable handguns, to match or exceed the                  rate of fire of many military machineguns with a single                  engagement of the trigger--up to 20 bullets in one                  second and 1,200 rounds in one minute. From 2017                  through 2021, ATF recovered 5,454 of these devices--a                  570 percent increase over the previous 5-year period.                  These devices are often illegally imported or illegally                  made on a 3D printer.                    Unserialized, 3D printed firearms--which can be used                  for illicit purposes such as gun trafficking,                  possession by people convicted of felonies or subject                  to domestic violence restraining orders, or unlawful                  engagement in the business of manufacturing or selling                  firearms--are another emerging threat. These firearms                  can be 3D printed from computer code downloaded from                  the internet and produced without serial numbers, which                  law enforcement uses to trace firearms recovered in                  criminal investigations. Some 3D printed firearms can                  be rendered undetectable by magnetometers used to                  secure airports, courthouses, and certain events. 3D                  printing technology is developing quickly, which can                  cause the safety threat of 3D printed firearms to                  suddenly increase.                  In addition to the threat of domestic crime, these                  emerging firearms threats pose a significant risk to                  the national security and foreign policy interests of                  the United States. Many foreign countries have heavily                  regulated automatic weapons and 3D printed and                  undetectable firearms. The wide availability of these                  emerging firearms threats would undermine other                  nations' gun laws and the safety and security of our                  allies. Technical data and software for 3D printed                  firearms and machinegun conversion devices can be used                  by international gangs, criminals, and terrorists in a                  manner contrary to United States national security and                  foreign policy interests.                  Multiple agencies have the authority to help stop the                  proliferation of these emerging threats, and it is the                  policy of the United States to work collectively across                  agencies to identify threats, engage in information                  sharing, and work together to develop and implement                  effective strategies to combat these threats.                  Authorities that can address emerging firearms threats                  extend beyond the Gun Control Act (Public Law 90-618)                  and the National Firearms Act (Public Law 73-474).                  Focused and enhanced coordination is needed to ensure a                  unified and robust strategy for enforcing existing                  legal authorities and using every available tool and                  resource. This interagency effort will build on the                  life-saving work that has occurred to date to stop the                  proliferation of machinegun conversion devices,                  including the ongoing efforts at the Department of                  Justice and ATF.                  My Administration also has invested significant                  resources in school safety and has taken steps to keeps                  firearms out of schools. These steps have focused on                  preventing unauthorized access to firearms for youth                  and individuals in crisis; supporting schools that are                  implementing evidence-based safety and gun-violence                  prevention and intervention solutions; and addressing                  the mental health needs of students, particularly those                  impacted by gun violence.                  Keeping students and educators, including teachers and                  other school personnel, safe from gun violence in their                  schools is a top priority for my Administration, but                  there is more to do to make our schools safer. Since                  the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado                  in 1999, according to one analysis, there have been                  more than 400 school shootings that exposed more than                  375,000 students to gun violence. Exposure to school                  shootings takes a terrible toll on students and                  educators. A nationally representative study found that                  51 percent of 14- to 17-year-olds in the United States                  worry about school shootings.                  The majority of States require schools to conduct                  active-shooter drills for students and educators. About                  95 percent of K-12 public schools in the United States                  conduct lockdown drills, which include drills to                  prepare for an active-shooter situation. These drills                  vary widely in their approach, and many parents,                  students, and educators have expressed concerns over                  the effectiveness of and trauma caused by some                  approaches to these drills.                  Despite their ubiquity, there is very limited research                  on how to design and deploy these drills to maximize                  their effectiveness and minimize any collateral harms                  they might cause. While additional research is ongoing,                  it is difficult to conclusively determine which                  specific practices are most effective in preparing                  schools for active-shooter incidents, preventing                  injuries                    and fatalities, and minimizing any associated                  psychological impacts or traumas. The Department of                  Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services,                  the Department of Education, and the Department of                  Homeland Security continue to work together on a range                  of school safety issues, including the beginnings of                  research into these important questions. It is time for                  these agencies to extend their efforts to help schools                  better design and conduct effective and age- and                  developmentally appropriate active-shooter drills.                  Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order:                      (a) The term ``machinegun'' has the meaning given                  by 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(24) and 26 U.S.C. 5845(b), and                  includes a ``machinegun conversion device,'' which is                  any part designed and intended solely and exclusively,                  or combination of parts designed and intended, for use                  in converting a weapon into a machinegun.                     (b) The term ``undetectable firearm'' means a                  firearm as proscribed by 18 U.S.C. 922(p).                     (c) The term ``3D printing'' refers to the additive                  manufacturing process, during which producers transmit                  digital designs to 3D printers. The computerized design                  guides the fabrication of products, building them up                  layer by layer rather than cutting away from a large                  block of existing material as in most traditional                  manufacturing. This term includes additive                  manufacturing technology used to produce a firearm,                  firearm frame or receiver, or machinegun conversion                  device.                  Sec. 3. Combating Emerging Firearms Threats. (a) There                  is hereby established an interagency Emerging Firearms                  Threats Task Force (Task Force). The Task Force shall                  be chaired by the Director of the Office of Gun                  Violence Prevention. In addition to the Chair, the Task                  Force shall consist of the following members:  (i) the Secretary of State;  (ii) the Attorney General;  (iii) the Secretary of Commerce;  (iv) the Secretary of Homeland Security;  (v) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;  (vi) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;  (vii) the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor;  (viii) the Counsel to the President;  (ix) the Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy  Council;  (x) the Deputy Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor to  the Vice President; and  (xi) the heads of such other agencies and offices as the Chair may from  time to time invite to participate.                      (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the                  Task Force shall submit to the President, through the                  Director of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, a                  report containing a risk assessment and strategy to                  stop the proliferation of machinegun conversion                  devices, with a particular emphasis on the devices used                  to convert a standard, semiautomatic firearm to a                  machinegun. The risk assessment and strategy shall                  include:  (i) information regarding the use, recovery, origins, and distribution  channels of machinegun conversion devices, including:    (A) the software or technology used for 3D printing machinegun conversion  devices; and    (B) the origins of machinegun conversion devices that are seized at ports  of entry, illegally imported into the United States, or otherwise recovered  by law enforcement agencies in the United States;    (ii) an assessment of existing applicable legal authorities of the agencies  represented on the Task Force and other agencies identified at the  direction of the Chair to regulate software or technology used to make  machinegun conversion devices, which shall include a review of export and  import laws;  (iii) an assessment of the technological and legal feasibility of 3D  printing companies designing 3D printers that block the functional  capacities of software that can 3D print machinegun conversion devices;  (iv) an assessment of the operational capabilities and legal authorities of  agencies to detect, intercept, and seize machinegun conversion devices that  are illegally imported or illegally produced domestically, including  through 3D printing;  (v) an interagency plan for expanding U.S. Customs and Border Protection  initiatives with Federal, State, Tribal, and local law enforcement to stop  the flow into the United States of machinegun conversion devices;  (vi) an interagency plan for seizing as criminal instrumentalities 3D  printers that are acquired for the purpose of illegally making machinegun  conversion devices and recommendations for additional administrative  actions necessary to facilitate such seizure;  (vii) an interagency plan for expanding partnerships with State, Tribal,  and local law enforcement for Federal training on identifying machinegun  conversion devices, tracing the firearms to which they were attached, and  submitting seizure data to ATF;  (viii) an interagency plan--with input from 3D data providers, technology  companies, and civil society--for voluntary, regulatory, and international  mechanisms to limit the availability on the internet of files used for the  purpose of unlawfully producing machinegun conversion devices;  (ix) an interagency plan for effective coordination to limit the illegal  export and import of software or technology on the internet that can be  readily used to 3D print machinegun conversion devices; and  (x) recommendations for any additional authorities or funding agencies need  from the Congress to more effectively address the proliferation of  machinegun conversion devices.                      (c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the                  Task Force shall submit to the President, through the                  Director of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, a                  report containing a risk assessment and strategy to                  address the emerging threat related to 3D printed                  firearms, including unserialized or undetectable 3D                  printed firearms. The risk assessment and strategy                  shall include:  (i) information regarding the usage, recovery, origins, and distribution  channels of 3D printed unserialized firearms and 3D printed undetectable  firearms, including the software or technology used for 3D printing  unserialized firearms or undetectable firearms;  (ii) an assessment of how 3D printing of firearms can facilitate violation  of the Undetectable Firearms Act (18 U.S.C. 922(p));  (iii) an assessment of existing authorities, including export and import  laws, that regulate software or technology used for 3D printing firearms,  including undetectable firearms;  (iv) an assessment of the technological feasibility of 3D printers  proactively blocking the functional capacities of software used to 3D print  undetectable firearms;  (v) an interagency plan for seizing as criminal instrumentalities 3D  printers acquired for the purpose of illegally producing or dealing in  firearms, including unserialized or undetectable firearms, or for the  purpose of producing firearms for criminal purposes, and recommendations  for additional administrative actions that may be necessary to facilitate  such seizures;    (vi) an interagency plan for effective coordination between the Department  of Justice and the Department of Commerce to limit the illegal export or  import of software or technology on the internet that can be readily used  to illegally 3D print firearms, including unserialized or undetectable  firearms;  (vii) an interagency plan for expanding partnerships with Federal, State,  Tribal, and local law enforcement to train them on identifying undetectable  or unserialized firearms made with 3D printing software or technology and  reporting recoveries of such firearms to ATF; and  (viii) recommendations for any additional authorities or funding the  agencies need from the Congress to more effectively address the problem of  3D printed firearms, including unserialized or undetectable firearms.                      (d) The Task Force shall be responsible for                  interagency coordination necessary to facilitate                  agencies' implementation of the recommendations and                  strategies in the reports described in subsections (b)                  and (c) of this section.                     (e) At the direction of the Chair, the Task Force                  may coordinate interagency efforts to address                  additional emerging firearms threats.                  Sec. 4. Understanding and Improving School-Based                  Active-Shooter Drills. (a) Within 110 days of the date                  of this order, the Secretary of Education and the                  Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with                  the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human                  Services, and the Surgeon General, shall develop and                  publish information about school-based active-shooter                  drills for schools, including institutions of higher                  education, and for State, Tribal, and local educational                  agencies. Such information shall include:  (i) a summary of existing research and recommendations on active-shooter  drills, including information on:    (A) how educators can collaborate within schools--as well as with  families; communities; State, Tribal, and local law enforcement; and other  emergency response officials--to implement drills that effectively prepare  a response to school-based active-shooter situations, including by  accounting for the particular needs of educators and students with  disabilities; sharing evidence-informed age- and developmentally  appropriate practices, such as those that prevent or limit trauma and  psychological harm to those participating in drills; and facilitating  effective and timely communication with students, educators, first  responders, family members, and other relevant stakeholders; and    (B) how schools must comply with Federal civil rights laws prohibiting  discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and  disability when creating, implementing, and evaluating active-shooter  drills, including by effectively serving educators and students with  disabilities as well as ensuring that communications with educators and  students consider their language-related needs (e.g., communicating in a  manner and language that educators and students are able to understand);  and  (ii) resources on school-based active-shooter drills, including information  on:    (A) the types of drills that may be appropriate to prepare students and  educators for school-based active-shooter situations; and    (B) how to create, implement, and evaluate evidence-informed, effective,  and age- and developmentally appropriate school-based drills, including:  (1) how best to engage with students, family members, educators, law  enforcement, and other relevant stakeholders on the process for creating,  implementing, and evaluating these drills;  (2) how best to communicate with students, family members, educators, and  other relevant stakeholders before, during, and after the drill, including  through the use of notification plans for students, educators, parents, and  other parties;    (3) how to prevent or limit trauma or psychological distress associated  with active-shooter drills and support students and educators who may  experience such trauma or psychological distress; and  (4) how best to serve people with disabilities and those with unique  language-related needs.                      (b) Within 110 days of the date of this order, the                  Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Homeland                  Security, in coordination with the Attorney General,                  the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the                  Surgeon General, shall develop and publish information                  on recommended areas for future research that can help                  inform policymakers, educators, students, parents, and                  other relevant stakeholders about different types of                  school-based active-shooter drills, the appropriate                  frequency of such drills, and the effects of such                  drills on students and educators. This information                  shall include potential funding sources that could help                  advance research on, and inform improvements to,                  active-shooter drills.                  Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order                  shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or  the head thereof; or  (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Policy. The Federal Government has made                  significant strides in implementing the Investing in                  America agenda, a historic set of recently enacted laws                  aimed at rebuilding American infrastructure, bringing                  back American manufacturing, and catalyzing a clean                  energy economy. That agenda has been furthered by                  Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022                  (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure                  Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022), and                  Executive Order 14080 of August 25, 2022                  (Implementation of the CHIPS Act of 2022). As                  implementation of the Investing in America agenda                  continues, it is essential that it supports the                  creation of well-paying jobs, especially union jobs,                  that improve opportunities for millions of Americans.                  Investing in American workers is critical to growing                  the economy equitably and resiliently, increasing our                  Nation's competitiveness, and ensuring our Nation's                  economic security. Workers understand the value of a                  good job that provides economic security for them and                  their families. Many companies also recognize that                  providing good-quality jobs while promoting workers'                  free and fair choice to join a union makes those                  companies employers of choice, creating a clear                  competitive advantage.                  The Federal Government has long promoted high labor                  standards to ensure fair competition, stability, and                  efficiency on federally assisted projects. The use of                  high labor standards on federally assisted projects,                  such as the use of prevailing wages, project labor                  agreements, and equal employment opportunity policies,                  dates back almost a century. These tools ensure timely                  and economical completion of projects, provide a                  reliable source of highly skilled workers, support                  equitable workforce development, and improve worker                  health and safety on the job, while also improving                  outcomes for the communities in which projects are                  located. But these tools can and should be employed to                  a greater extent than they have been in the past.                  For instance, providing incentives for federally                  assisted projects with high labor standards--including                  those using collective bargaining agreements, project                  labor agreements, and certain community benefits                  agreements--drives efficient project completion while                  also supporting high-quality jobs, worker safety, and                  broader investment in communities. Ensuring that                  workers on federally assisted projects are paid                  competitive and equitable wages will enhance worker                  productivity, generate higher-quality work, and reduce                  turnover, providing value for taxpayers. Promoting                  inclusivity, with equal opportunity for all qualified                  workers, will help ensure that federally assisted                  projects have the workforce needed to implement the                  Investing in America agenda.                  Therefore, it is the policy of my Administration to                  promote the creation of equitable workforce development                  pathways for workers to obtain good jobs that pay                  family-sustaining wages, provide critical benefits,                  prevent workplace discrimination, ensure worker safety,                  and allow workers a free and fair chance to join a                  union.

In selecting                  projects for receiving Federal financial assistance                  from the Investing in America agenda, implementing                  agencies shall consider actions that, as appropriate                  and consistent with applicable law:                      (a) Prioritize projects for selection that provide                  a clear plan for efficient project delivery by                  promoting positive labor-management relations. Examples                  of instruments and policies that implementing agencies                  could consider encouraging applicants to adopt, as                  appropriate, may include: project labor agreements,                  community benefits agreements, collective bargaining                  agreements, agreements intended to ensure the                  uninterrupted delivery of services,                    agreements designed to facilitate first collective                  bargaining agreements, voluntary union recognition, and                  neutrality by the employer with respect to union                  organizing.                     (b) Prioritize projects that enhance worker                  productivity by promoting family-sustaining wages.                  Examples of policies that implementing agencies could                  consider encouraging applicants to adopt, as                  appropriate, may include: payment of wages tied to a                  particular metric--such as wages not less than                  prevailing wages, the upper quartile of industry pay,                  or union pattern wage scales--including for workers in                  the care workforce, that is, individuals working in the                  fields of child care and long-term care; policies to                  promote equal pay and eliminate discriminatory pay                  practices, such as transparency measures; and other                  policies aligned with the Good Jobs Principles                  established by the Department of Commerce and the                  Department of Labor on June 21, 2022.                     (c) Prioritize projects that supply critical                  benefits that promote economic security for workers,                  such as paid leave (including paid sick, family, and                  medical leave); health care; retirement benefits; and                  child, dependent, and elder care.                     (d) Prioritize projects that promote and expand                  access to, and put in place policies that combat                  discrimination that limits employment in, high-quality                  jobs for workers from underserved communities. Examples                  of policies that implementing agencies could consider                  encouraging applicants to adopt, as appropriate, may                  include: workforce plans that contain strategies for                  recruiting, hiring, and retaining workers from                  underserved and local communities; policies that help                  prevent workplace discrimination and harassment,                  including through reporting structures and ongoing                  training; and participation in programs designed to                  support compliance with existing equal employment                  opportunity obligations under Executive Order 11246 of                  September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), as                  amended, section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973                  (Public Law 93-112), the Vietnam Era Veterans'                  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1972 (Public Law 92-                 540), as amended, and their implementing regulations.                     (e) Prioritize projects that strengthen workforce                  development by expanding worker access to high-quality                  training and portable credentials that lead to good                  jobs. Examples of policies that implementing agencies                  could consider encouraging applicants to adopt, as                  appropriate, may include: the use of joint labor-                 management partnerships that invest in union-affiliated                  training programs, registered apprenticeships, and pre-                 apprenticeship programs that matriculate to registered                  apprenticeships; partnerships with organizations that                  deliver training such as community colleges, career and                  technical education programs, disability service                  organizations, the public workforce system, and the                  American Climate Corps; and the provision of supportive                  services necessary to complete training such as child                  care and transportation assistance.                     (f) Prioritize projects that promote and protect                  worker health and safety through policies that                  encourage supplemental safety training, worker and                  union participation in the design and implementation of                  workplace safety and health management systems, and                  disclosure of occupational safety and health                  violations.                  Sec. 4. Implementation Approach. (a) Implementing                  agencies shall, as appropriate and consistent with                  applicable law, consider the following strategies in                  connection with their Federal financial assistance                  programs to promote the implementation priorities                  identified in section 3 of this order:  (i) including application evaluation criteria or selection factors that  prioritize applicants that adopt or provide a specific plan to adopt those  priorities;  (ii) publishing best practice guides and other guidance to applicants to  promote and implement those priorities, including guides on what types    of Federal financial assistance can be used for workforce development, such  as supportive services;  (iii) engaging with applicants, where appropriate, during pre-award  processes to ensure that applicants understand the benefits of those  priorities for key programs and projects;  (iv) collecting relevant data to demonstrate funding recipients' progress,  including by:    (A) requesting in funding notices or through other appropriate mechanisms  that applicants address a series of ``yes'' or ``no'' questions regarding  the implementation of those priorities to ensure transparency of labor  practices and commitments;    (B) using existing compliance practices (such as the collection of  certified payrolls when applicable) to collect detailed data on job  quality, equity, and worker empowerment; and    (C) requesting reporting on key metrics and encouraging voluntary public  reporting of additional relevant metrics developed by the implementing  agency;  (v) promoting compliance with Federal law and commitments made by  applicants, including, as appropriate, referring alleged violations of law  to other executive departments and agencies for a determination of whether  circumstances warrant the issuance of financial penalties or collection of  relief for workers harmed, withholding further Federal financial assistance  pending correction of a deficiency, recovery of some or all Federal funds,  or debarment; and  (vi) supporting program staff and developing implementing agency expertise,  including by consulting the Department of Labor and implementing agency  labor advisors, to train program staff on how to implement those priorities  and ensure that staff have the expertise needed to support the creation of  good jobs through each phase of project delivery on federally assisted  projects.                      (b) Implementing agencies shall carry out their                  responsibilities under this order consistent with their                  responsibilities under the Justice40 Initiative set                  forth in Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021                  (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad).                  Sec. 5. Investing in Good Jobs Task Force. (a) There is                  established within the Executive Office of the                  President the Investing in Good Jobs Task Force (Task                  Force). The function of the Task Force is to coordinate                  policy development that supports efficient project                  delivery while also driving the creation of high-                 quality jobs and to otherwise support the effective                  implementation of this order. The Task Force shall be                  co-chaired by the Secretary of Labor and the Assistant                  to the President for Economic Policy and Director of                  the National Economic Council or their designees.                      (b) In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force                  shall consist of the following members or their                  designees:  (i) the Secretary of the Interior;  (ii) the Secretary of Agriculture;  (iii) the Secretary of Commerce;  (iv) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;  (v) the Secretary of Transportation;  (vi) the Secretary of Energy;  (vii) the Secretary of Education;  (viii) the Secretary of Homeland Security;  (ix) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;  (x) the Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor;    (xi) the Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy;  (xii) the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality;  (xiii) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;  (xiv) the Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy  Council;  (xv) the Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy  Council; and  (xvi) the heads of other executive departments, agencies, and offices as  the Co-Chairs may from time to time invite to participate.                      (c) The Task Force shall assist implementing                  agencies in promoting the implementation priorities                  identified in section 3 of this order. To do so, the                  Task Force shall:  (i) share and, as appropriate, develop best practices related to promoting  adoption of the implementation priorities identified in section 3 of this  order, and provide technical assistance to implementing agencies in  implementing these best practices;  (ii) support implementing agencies as they develop expertise in promoting  efficient project delivery while also driving the creation of high-quality  jobs; and  (iii) engage in other appropriate activities as determined by the Task  Force, consistent with applicable law, to support effective implementation  of this order.                  Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order                  shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or  the head thereof; or  (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.                      (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with                  applicable law and subject to the availability of                  appropriations.                        (c) This order is not intended to, and does not,                  create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,                  enforceable at law or in equity by any party against                  the United States, its departments, agencies, or                  entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any                  other person.                                                       \n",

Initiative on Advancing Educational                  Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through                  Hispanic-Serving Institutions                  By the authority vested in me as President by the                  Constitution and the laws of the United States of                  America, and in order to advance equity in economic and                  educational opportunities, strengthen the capacity of                  Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) to provide a high-                 quality education, increase opportunities for these                  institutions to participate in and benefit from Federal                  programs, and ensure that HSIs can continue to be                  engines of educational opportunity and economic                  mobility, it is hereby ordered as follows:                  Section 1. Policy. Hispanic-Serving Institutions have a                  history of expanding educational opportunities for                  generations of Hispanic and Latino students. As defined                  in section 502(a)(5) of the Higher Education Act of                  1965 (20 U.S.C. 1101a(a)(5)), HSIs are institutions of                  higher education that have an enrollment of at least 25                  percent Hispanic undergraduate full-time-equivalent                  students and satisfy other criteria, including with                  respect to enrollment of needy students and                  expenditures per full-time-equivalent undergraduate                  student.                  Today, more than 500 HSIs, located in 27 States, the                  District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, serve more than                  4.7 million students annually. Hispanic-Serving                  Institutions vary in size; support a range of academic                  interests; and serve urban, rural, and suburban                  communities. Over half of Hispanic and Latino                  postsecondary students in America attend an HSI, and                  nearly 40 percent of those students attend a 2-year                  HSI. Hispanic-Serving Institutions serve a significant                  number of students from low-income backgrounds.                  Students enrolled at HSIs account for approximately 30                  percent of all Pell Grant recipients, even though these                  colleges and universities make up only 13 percent of                  all postsecondary degree-granting institutions.                  Further, HSIs can play a critical role in fostering                  diversity in science, technology, engineering, and                  mathematics fields. Notably, 69 percent of doctoral                  students in HSIs are enrolled in science- and                  engineering-related degrees, highlighting the                  significant role HSIs can play in ensuring a workforce                  that meets the Nation's evolving needs in technical                  fields.                  As Hispanic and Latino college enrollment has grown to                  historic levels over the last few decades, so has the                  number of HSIs, making HSIs' success vital to the                  strength of the Nation. These institutions are creating                  and implementing evidence-based practices that lead to                  Hispanic and Latino student success.                  Despite the fact that HSIs represent a large and fast-                 growing segment of the Nation's colleges and                  universities, per-student Federal funding at HSIs is 25                  percent less than at other degree-granting                  institutions. Over the last 30 years, the number of                  HSIs has more than doubled and Hispanic or Latino                  student enrollment at HSIs has more than tripled. But                  per-student Federal funding at HSIs remains low                  compared to degree-granting institutions generally, and                  many HSIs report having unmet physical and digital                  infrastructure needs. This scarcity of resources often                  leaves HSIs at a disadvantage when compared with                  better-resourced institutions. Students, faculty, and                  staff at under-resourced HSIs often face challenges in                  accessing the resources they need to excel.                    Despite these funding disparities, research has shown                  that HSIs tend to do more for Hispanic and Latino                  student success than non-HSI colleges and                  universities--and do so with fewer resources. Many HSIs                  are leaders in promoting economic mobility for Hispanic                  and Latino students, including by closing college                  access, completion, and success gaps. Hispanic-Serving                  Institutions could further improve outcomes for                  students if they were adequately funded. The Federal                  Government must strengthen the capacity of HSIs to                  improve and expand their reach, while recognizing that                  HSIs face discrete challenges and opportunities that                  reflect their history and the communities they serve.                  As set forth in Executive Order 14045 of September 13,                  2021 (White House Initiative on Advancing Educational                  Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for                  Hispanics), the Federal Government must collaborate                  with Hispanic and Latino communities to ensure their                  long-term success, including by eliminating barriers to                  Federal funding and strengthening the capacity of HSIs.                  This order builds on those policies by establishing the                  White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity,                  Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through Hispanic-                 Serving Institutions and the President's Board of                  Advisors on Hispanic-Serving Institutions.                  It is the policy of my Administration to advance                  educational equity, excellence, and economic                  opportunity through strong partnerships with HSIs to                  ensure that they have access to Federal resources to                  help current and future generations of students                  succeed. The Federal Government must collaborate with                  HSIs and the students, families, and communities they                  serve to address and overcome barriers that may impede                  educational attainment and upward economic mobility.                  Strengthening the capacity of the Nation's HSIs is                  critical to fulfilling that objective.                  Sec. 2. White House Initiative on Advancing Educational                  Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through                  Hispanic-Serving Institutions.

(d) The Department shall provide funding and                  administrative support for the Board to the extent                  permitted by law and within existing appropriations.                  Members of the Board shall serve without compensation,                  but may                    be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu                  of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons                  serving intermittently in the Government service (5                  U.S.C. 5701-5707).

(b) The heads of agencies shall assist and provide                  information to the Initiative and the Board established                  in this order, consistent with applicable law, as may                  be necessary to carry out the functions of the                  Initiative and the Board.                     (c) Each agency shall bear its own expenses of                  participating in the Initiative established in this                  order.                  Sec. 5. General Provisions.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Executive Order 14123 of June 14, 2024                   White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience                  By the authority vested in me as President by the                  Constitution and the laws of the United States of                  America, it is hereby ordered as follows:                  Section 1. Policy. As described in Executive Order                  14017 of February 24, 2021 (America's Supply Chains),                  it is the policy of my Administration to strengthen the                  enduring resilience of America's supply chains. The                  United States needs resilient, diverse, and secure                  supply chains to ensure our economic prosperity, public                  health, and national security. Pandemics and other                  biological threats, cyber attacks, climate stressors                  and extreme weather events, transnational corruption,                  terrorist attacks, geopolitical disputes, unfair                  economic competition, and other disruptive conditions                  can reduce critical infrastructure, manufacturing, and                  processing capacity and the availability of critical                  goods, materials, and services. Building resilient                  American supply chains will necessitate enhancing                  domestic manufacturing capacity, supporting America's                  competitive edge in research and development,                  encouraging innovation, reinforcing critical                  infrastructure, and creating well-paying jobs. Building                  resilient American supply chains will also provide a                  foundation to strengthen prosperity, advance the fight                  against climate change, enhance national emergency                  preparedness, and encourage economic growth across the                  Nation.                  More resilient supply chains are secure and diverse.                  Characteristics of resilient supply chains include                  greater domestic production; a diverse and agile                  supplier base; built-in redundancies; a reliable                  transportation system; secure critical infrastructure;                  adequate stockpiles; safe and secure data networks;                  reliable food systems; and a world-class, globally                  competitive American manufacturing base and workforce.                  Close cooperation on building global supply chain                  resilience with allies and partners who share our                  values will foster collective economic and national                  security, encourage innovation, and strengthen the                  capacity to respond to and recover from international                  disasters and emergencies.                  Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order:                      (a) ``Agency'' has the meaning given to that term                  in Executive Order 14017.                     (b) ``Critical goods and materials'' has the                  meaning given to that term in Executive Order 14017.                     (c) ``Other essential goods, materials, and                  services'' means goods, materials, and services that                  are essential to national and economic security,                  emergency preparedness, or to advance the policy set                  forth in section 1 of this order, but not included                  within the definition of ``critical goods and                  materials.''                     (d) ``Critical infrastructure'' means assets,                  systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual,                  that are so vital to the United States that their                  incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating                  effect on national security, economic security,                  national public health or safety, or any combination                  thereof.                  Sec. 3. Coordination. (a) This order supplements and                  reaffirms the principles governing America's supply                  chains established in Executive Order 14017. Any                  provisions of Executive Order 14017 not amended in this                  order shall remain in effect.

In coordinating the work of the Council                  on issues related to national security, and on other                  issues as they deem appropriate, the APNSA and the APEP                  shall work with the Council in conformance with the                  interagency process identified in National Security                  Memorandum 2 of February 4, 2021 (Renewing the National                  Security Council System).                  Sec. 4. White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience.                  (a) The White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience                  residing within the Executive Office of the President                  is led by the APNSA and the APEP, who serve as Co-                 Chairs of the Council.

(c) The Council shall coordinate and promote                  Federal Government efforts to strengthen long-term                  supply chain resilience and American industrial                  competitiveness; identify and provide a coordinated                  response to address supply chain insecurities, threats,                  and vulnerabilities, including excessive geographic or                  supplier concentration; and facilitate collaboration by                  agencies with allies and partners to foster greater                  global supply chain resilience. To serve these                  purposes, the Council shall:  (i) recommend to agencies procedures and best practices for agency  cooperation and coordination on data collection and analysis, especially to  the extent that agency missions may overlap or intersect, and help  facilitate such cooperation and coordination;  (ii) identify budgetary and any other resources needed to support supply  chain resilience, including resources to build strong and enduring agency  capabilities to identify, address, mitigate, and prevent supply chain  risks, shocks, and disruptions;  (iii) recommend administrative actions that would further the policy  objectives set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 14017 and in section 1  of this order;  (iv) coordinate with other interagency bodies managing policy areas that  affect the integrity of supply chains; and  (v) coordinate with agencies, to the extent appropriate and consistent with  applicable law, to ensure that agency operations related to building  critical supply chain resilience are conducted in a manner that promotes a  fair, open, and competitive marketplace and empowers workers to advocate  for their rights and quality jobs.                      (d) The Council shall, as appropriate and                  consistent with applicable law, consult outside                  stakeholders--such as private industry; academic and                  educational institutions; non-governmental                  organizations; labor unions; and State, local, Tribal,                  and territorial governments--on an individual basis to                  help accomplish the policy objectives identified in                  section 1 of this order and in section 1 of Executive                  Order 14017. Any member of the Council that receives a                  recommendation from a Federal Advisory Committee, as                  that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 1001(2), regarding                  industrial resilience and competitiveness or supply                  chain risks, resilience, diversity, or sustainability                  shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable                  law, share that recommendation with the Council.                     (e) The Council shall conduct a quadrennial supply                  chain review of industries critical to national or                  economic security. The review shall address the                  processes in place to monitor supply chains and the                  timeliness of the associated data. At the conclusion of                  each review, the Council shall submit a report to the                  President, with the first report submitted no later                  than December 31, 2024, and subsequent reports                  submitted every 4 years thereafter. Where practicable                  and as appropriate, the report shall make                  recommendations concerning:  (i) Federal incentives and any potential amendments to Federal procurement  regulations that may be necessary to attract and retain private sector  investments in the supply chains for critical goods and materials and other  essential goods, materials, and services as defined in section 2 of this  order, including any new programs that could encourage both domestic and  foreign investment in the supply chains for critical goods and materials  and other essential goods, materials, and services;  (ii) a strategic plan that includes diplomatic, economic, security,  international development, trade, and other policy actions to guide United  States engagement with allies and partners, including through regional    economic frameworks or partnerships supported by the United States, to  strengthen global supply chain resilience in critical sectors;  (iii) actions for the insulation of Federal supply chain analyses and  actions from conflicts of interest, corruption, or the appearance of  impropriety to ensure continued integrity and public confidence in supply  chain analyses and actions;  (iv) potential legislative changes that would promote the policy objectives  set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 14017 and in section 1 of this  order;  (v) reforms to domestic and international trade rules and agreements that  could be pursued to support supply chain resilience, security, diversity,  sustainability, and strength;  (vi) education and workforce reforms needed to strengthen the domestic  industrial base for critical goods and materials and other essential goods,  materials, and services; and  (vii) steps to ensure that the Federal Government's supply chain policies  support small businesses and family-owned small- and mid-sized farming  operations, prevent monopolization, strengthen critical infrastructure,  empower workers to advocate for their rights and quality jobs, consider  climate and other health and environmental effects, encourage economic  growth in underserved communities and economically distressed areas, and  promote the geographic dispersal of economic activity across all regions of  the United States.                      (f) Subsection (e) of this section supersedes                  section 5(c) of Executive Order 14017.                     (g) Each member of the Council shall designate,                  within 30 days of the date of this order, a senior                  official within their respective agency or office who                  shall coordinate with the Council and who shall be                  responsible for overseeing the agency's or office's                  efforts to address supply chain resilience. The Co-                 Chairs may designate Council subgroups consisting of                  Council members or their designees, as appropriate.                     (h) The Council shall meet on a semiannual basis                  unless the Co-Chairs determine that a meeting is                  unnecessary or that additional meetings are needed.  (i) Each agency or office shall bear its own expenses for participating in  the Council.                  Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order                  shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or  the head thereof; or  (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.                      (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with                  applicable law and subject to the availability of                  appropriations.                        (c) This order is not intended to, and does not,                  create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,                  enforceable at law or in equity by any party against                  the United States, its departments, agencies, or                  entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any                  other person.                                                       \n",
